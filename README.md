# Implement dashboard using QT 5

## What is Qt?
* Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces. 
* It can run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed. 
* Qt also provides Qt Quick, that includes a declarative scripting language called QML that allows using JavaScript to provide the logic.</li>
